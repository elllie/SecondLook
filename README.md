# SecondLook - A Mobile Phone Intervention for Digital Dating Abuse

## Abstract

Digital dating abuse has become a significant mental health crisis among the college-going population. Nearly half of all college women who are dating report experiencing violent and abusive dating behaviors. Existing technology and non-technology based intervention programs do not provide assistance at the onset of abuse.

SecondLook is an Android application that consists of a detection tool that classifies abusive digital content exchanged between partners, an educational component that provides information about healthy relationships, and a list of nearby resources for users to locate help.
