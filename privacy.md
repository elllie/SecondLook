# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy describes the privacy practices for SecondLook. It applies solely to information collected by this application. (**Collection** in this case refers to data that passes through our servers. It does not apply to data that lives solely on your device.) It will notify you of the following:

1. What information is collected from you through the app,
2. how this data is used, and
3. who it is shared with.
2. The choices available to you regarding the collection and use of your data.
3. The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.

## Information Collection and Use

The *vast majority* of data provided to SecondLook is only stored locally, and there are no mechanisms in place allowing this data to leave your device. This section describes how we deal with all the data SecondLook requires to function properly.

### Data that is stored on our servers

* **Analytics information** aggregates (if you have opted in to such data collection) regarding which features of the app are used more commonly than others and in which order users generally try each feature. This data is fully anonymous and aggregated. It cannot be traced back to any particular user.

### Data that is collected by our servers but never stored

* **Text message bodies** are sent to the abuse detection program and immediately returned to your device. They may live in memory on the server for up to 24 hours but are never accessible by a human and are never stored in a persistent location.

### Data that is never collected by our servers

* **Relationship quiz answers** are never sent to any server for analysis. The results are computed using a point tally system that lives on your device and are deleted as soon as you exit the page.

* **SMS/contact information metadata** is only used to locate the text messages SecondLook will send to the server. Only the message bodies are sent. All other information is discarded immediately.

* **Location information.** The resources listed are stored in a local database, and your location is only used to search within that database.

## Information Sharing

Data collected may be used by New College of Florida for research purposes. **We will never sell, rent, or otherwise provide your data to a third party.** We *may* publish anonymized findings about the data in academic literature.

## What you can do about your data collection

Analytics information is opt-in only and you can change your decision at any time within the app settings.
